# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Fundamentals

Hello everyone, 

Welcome to my repository!

This repository serves as a storage space for essential materials related to the theory of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I've crafted these resources from the ground up, starting with the mathematical foundations. For Machine Learning, I primarily use Numpy, while for Deep Learning, I rely on PyTorch.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to cater to beginners and anyone interested in gaining a deep understanding of the foundational concepts in Data Science. Here, you'll find:

- **Mathematical Foundations**: I've delved into the mathematics behind Machine Learning and Deep Learning, providing clear explanations and examples.

- **Numpy-based Machine Learning**: Learn how to implement Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Numpy. Understand the inner workings of models, optimization techniques, and more.

- **PyTorch for Deep Learning**: Explore the world of Deep Learning with PyTorch. Build neural networks, understand backpropagation, and create your deep learning models.

- **Hands-On Examples**: To reinforce your learning, I've included practical examples and projects that you can work on. These examples bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.

Whether you're new to the field or looking to deepen your knowledge, this repository is a valuable resource to explore the beautiful foundation of Data Science. Feel free to browse through the materials and get started on your journey to mastering Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts.

Happy learning!
